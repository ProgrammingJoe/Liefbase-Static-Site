Some things that matter to us
Transparency and Accountability
We believe that transparency and accountability between disaster relief organizations, government organizations, and the public will save time and resources, promote stronger relationships, and foster collaboration.
Integrity and Security
We offer secure and confidential platforms that provide organizations and the public with assurance that their data and personal information will be safeguarded against loss or theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure.
Impartiality and Neutrality
Our goal is developing tools accessible to all organizations and persons during relief efforts. We are committed to working with all people and organizations fairly, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, ancestry, nationality, religion, physical or mental disability, age, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

We appreciate your support!
Liefbase is developing platforms to help communities and organizations around the world work together in times of stress. We believe that rather than charging all of our users to use the platform, we should instead give people the opportunity to donate and help others when they are in need. In disasters and relief efforts we are all on the same side and your donations help keep the Liefbase community growing and cohesive.
Rest assured that the donations you make today may help get resources to people in need in times of stress.
